# What is it?

io.vefskoli.is is an LMS ( Learning Management System) for the [Reykjavik Academy of Web Development](https://en.tskoli.is/study-programme/reykjavik-academy-of-web-development/). In this system students can review each other's projects and give the review they got a grade on the scale from 0 to 10. This encourages students to make good reviews, they look more into their co students projects, get another perspective of the projects they have been doing and get better at giving feedback to others, which is a very good skill to have when they go into the working life.


# How to contribute to this project


### Make an issue and fork

To contribute to this project it is best to start by creating an issue here on GitHub (see “Issues” in the upper-left corner of the screen). Then fork this project to your own account by clicking the “Fork” in the upper-right corner of the screen. You will then get a screen with a green button in the lower-right corner saying “Create fork”. Now you have a copy of the project on your own GitHub account.


### Clone the repository

To clone the repository open a terminal in the folder where you store your projects (don’t make a new folder for the project because the clone command will make a folder called “io.vefskoli.is”). Write:


#### git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/io.vefskoli.is

and press enter. This will start a short process that takes a few seconds and after that you should be able to see the folder when you write ls in your terminal. Now open the folder in VSCode ( if you used the VSCode terminal to do this I recommend still opening the new folder in VSCode because if you don’t do that you will need to write cd io.tskoli.is to open the folder in the terminal and whenever you open a new terminal you would again need to remember to type in cd io.tskoli.is )
